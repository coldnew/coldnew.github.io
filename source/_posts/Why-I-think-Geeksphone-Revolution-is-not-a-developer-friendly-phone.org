In [[http://coldnew.github.io/blog/2015/06/08_gp_revolution1.html][previous post]] (in Chinese) I said [[http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/phones/9-revolution.html][Geeksphone Revolution]] is not a developer friendly phone,
why? Let's take a look at an advertisement on official site:

[[file:Why-I-think-Geeksphone-Revolution-is-not-a-developer-friendly-phone/b1.png]]

Well, it looks like this device is really cool and nice, isn't it ? I haved test
it's OTA method to install Firefox OS from AOSP in [[http://coldnew.github.io/blog/2015/06/08_gp_revolution1.html][previous post]] (in Chinese),
and it all looks good, what's the problem ? The advertisement say, you can
seamlessly switch to Boot2Gecko by Mozilla, or any other community-supported
flavor of an OS, but actually geeksphone revolution is not supported by
Mozilla officially, you can find this on [[https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G/blob/master/config.sh#L118][mozilla-b2g/B2G/config.sh]] , there's
peaks, keon, but no revolution.

#+BEGIN_alert
At time of writing, the geekphons co-founder [[http://forum.geeksphone.com/index.php?topic%3D6446.0][said]] that all FxOs development are
finished by Geeksphone, which means you will not receive Firefox OS 2.2 or
above update.

I think the reason why revolution can't add into B2G's config.sh is Intel, this
device use Intel Atom Z2560 which shipped with PowerVR GPU, a well-known
opensource unfriendly GPU manufacture. Though opensource community [[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page%3Dnews_item&px%3DOTEwMA][has been]]
thinking about create opensource driver by reverse engineering, it haven't even
made a devent in this [[http://libv.livejournal.com/26972.html][job]].

Another problem is caused by Intel, let's see what's boot.img provide by
[[http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/phones/9-revolution.html][Geenkphone Revolution]] looks like:

mmm... what's problem ? Let's look at Android's boot.img

Do you find what's wrong? The boot.img used in Android is start from =ANDROID!=
, which means the boot.img used in [[http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/phones/9-revolution.html][Geeksphone Revolution]] is a special one, maybe
it's signed. We can find some info in [[https://lwn.net/Articles/638627/][LWN.net]], let me put it this way, Intel's
x86 Android is really care about security, even a boot.img need to be signed, so
there's no annoying third party developer will try to hack your device. Oh my
god...actually the signed tool will not provide to anyone, we can find this in
[[https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/537387][Intel Developer Zone]]. Since that, we can see following info in [[http://forum.geeksphone.com/index.php?topic%3D6280.0][CM11 building
tutorial]]:

[[file:Why-I-think-Geeksphone-Revolution-is-not-a-developer-friendly-phone/b2.png]]

Aha! You can build the rootfs, but the boot.img you can't modified by
your self. I think it's the main reason why Mozilla can't add this device to
their config.sh, you can't modify the Linux Kernel or ramdisk.This is really
annoying, take Ubuntu Touch as example, we need to enable LXC relative feature
in Linux Kernel so that we can porting this device to Ubuntu Touch.

Besides Linux Kernel, let us see what GPL sources provide by geeksphone, you can
find it [[http://forum.geeksphone.com/index.php?topic%3D6037.0][here]], in their post, they said they has repo host on [[https://github.com/gp-b2g][GitHub]] , let's see
what's on GitHub, first you see this

[[file:Why-I-think-Geeksphone-Revolution-is-not-a-developer-friendly-phone/b3.png]]

mmm... their contribute frequency is less then myself, ok it dosen't matter,
give me source is enough, so I click into the [[https://github.com/gp-b2g/gp-revolution-gecko][gp-revolution-gecko]] ......

[[file:Why-I-think-Geeksphone-Revolution-is-not-a-developer-friendly-phone/b4.png]]

What the fuck!! =first commit!!= =first commit!!!= =first commit!!!=,
geeksphone's developer erase all git commit log, you can merge all your
contribure to one patch, but =please don't remove other contribute info= ....

That's the main reason I say Geeksphone Revolution is not developer friendly, I
am still trying to build unofficial port on this device.
